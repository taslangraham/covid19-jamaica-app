        <p>
          Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus
          will experience mild to moderate respiratory
          illness and recover without requiring special
          treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical
          problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic
          respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
